# E-Commerce Website

This is a modern e-commerce website built with Next.js, Sanity as the backend CMS, and Stripe for payment processing. The website provides a seamless shopping experience from browsing products, adding to cart and completing a purchase. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices and images are dynamically fetched from the Sanity backend, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

- **Checkout Process**: Secure checkout process powered by Stripe API, handling payments and order processing.
- **Order Summary**: View a detailed summary of the order after checkout, including product details, quantities, and total cost.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A web development framework for building interactive websites
- **Sanity**: A headless CMS used to manage product information, orders, and other content.
- **Stripe API**: Used for secure payment processing.
- **Vercel**: Deployment and hosting platform.
## Future
This project is not done yet and more features will be added as I continue to learn more about full stack development. 
- **Testing**: I will be learning more about testing full stack applications and implementing unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
- **User Login**: Allow users to login with an account (storing user information in the Sanity database), allowing them to view and track their orders
